            <h4>Web Developer and Cinematographer</h4>
            <p>I'm often threatened
                Also a gripping terror
                I often got rid of
                Until when
                I can drown in the ocean
                I could be poisoned in the air
                I could be killed on the sidewalk
                But I never die
                Won't stop
                I'm often threatened
                Also a gripping terror
                I can be made to suffer
                I can be rendered lifeless
                In the electric chair or stabbed
                But I never die
                Won't stop
                But I never die
                Won't stop
                I can be made to suffer
                I can be rendered lifeless
                In the electric chair or stabbed
                I can drown in the ocean
                I could be poisoned in the air
                I could be killed on the sidewalk
                But I never die
                Won't stop.</p>
